## HIITrainer: 3-in-1 High Intensity Interval Training App

I built this exercise app with three primary functions:

- Timer - displays countdown timer for exercise/rest intervals in high-intensity interval training workouts
- Builder - allows users to create their own custom HIIT workouts, which are saved to local browser storage
- Tracker - allows users to track the historical data for their completed workouts, which are saved to local browser storage

This app was created with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and create-next-app, and uses React Hooks. The animated gifs were created by me.
